/-- A generic postcondition-style correctness predicate for executed kernels. -/
def Correct (k : Kernel) (post : BlockState → BlockState → Prop) : Prop :=
  ∀ s s', exec k s = some s' → post s s'

/--
Algorithmic correctness for kernels that carry explicit `.fp32` / `.fp16` /
`.bf16` annotations in the current real-valued semantics.

The theorem is stated on the dtype-annotated kernel `k`, but the proof runs the
erased Real kernel `k.eraseFloat`. This is the formal Lean proof layer for
float-facing kernels: state float, prove Real.

def AlgorithmCorrect (k : Kernel) (post : BlockState → BlockState → Prop) : Prop :=
  Correct k.eraseFloat post

/--
Computational correctness for observed floating outputs, expressed as an
epsilon bound against a mathematical specification.

This predicate is intentionally observation-level: `obs` may fail if the kernel
does not produce the expected output. It is the right shape for test-backed or
future IEEE-level claims; it is not used to prove Real algorithmic correctness.
